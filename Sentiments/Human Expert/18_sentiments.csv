“Arjuna asked: O mighty One! I desire to know how relinquishment is distinguished from renunciation. ,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
 Lord Shri Krishna replied: The sages say that renunciation means forgoing an action which springs from desire; and relinquishing means the surrender of its fruit. ,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" Some philosophers say that all action is evil and should be abandoned. Others that acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up. ",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
O best of Indians! Listen to my judgment as regards this problem. It has a threefold aspect.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up but should be performed, for they purify the aspiring soul.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 But they should be done with detachment and without thought of recompense. This is my final judgment. ,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" It is not right to give up actions which are obligatory; and if they are misunderstood, it is the result of sheer ignorance. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" To avoid an action through fear of physical suffering, because it is likely to be painful, is to act from passion, and the benefit of renunciation will not follow. ",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
" He who performs an obligatory action, because he believes it to be a duty which ought to be done, without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any return – such renunciation is Pure. ",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
" The wise man who has attained purity, whose doubts are solved, who is filled with the spirit of self-abnegation, does not shrink from action because it brings pain, nor does he desire it because it brings pleasure. ",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" But since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action, in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" For those who cannot renounce all desire, the fruit of action hereafter is threefold – good, evil, and partly good and partly evil. But for him who has renounced, there is none. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
" I will tell you now, O Mighty Man, the five causes which, according to the final decision of philosophy, must concur before an action can be accomplished. ",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
" They are a body, a personality, physical organs, their manifold activity and destiny. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" Whatever action a man performs, whether by muscular effort or by speech or by thought, and whether it be right or wrong, these five are the essential causes. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" But the fool who supposes, because of his immature judgment, that it is his own Self alone that acts, he perverts the truth and does not see rightly. ",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
" He who has no pride, and whose intellect is unalloyed by attachment, even though he kill these people, yet he does not kill them, and his act does not bind him. ",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
" Knowledge, the knower and the object of knowledge, these are the three incentives to action; and the act, the actor and the instrument are the threefold constituents. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" The knowledge, the act and the doer differ according to the Qualities. Listen to this too: ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" That knowledge which sees the One Indestructible in all beings, the One Indivisible in all separate lives, may be truly called Pure Knowledge. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 The knowledge which thinks of the manifold existence in all beings as separate – that comes from Passion. ,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
" But that which clings blindly to one idea as if it were all, without logic, truth or insight, that has its origin in Darkness. ",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
" An obligatory action done by one who is disinterested, who neither likes nor dislikes it, and gives no thought to the consequences that follow, such an action is Pure. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" But even though an action involve the most strenuous endeavour, yet if the doer is seeking to gratify his desires, and is filled with personal vanity, it may be assumed to originate in Passion. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" An action undertaken through delusion, and with no regard to the spiritual issues involved, or the real capacity of the doer, or to the injury which may follow, such an act may be assumed to be the product of Ignorance. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" But when a man has no sentiment and no personal vanity, when he possesses courage and confidence, cares not whether he succeeds or fails, then his action arises from Purity. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" In him who is impulsive, greedy, looking for reward, violent, impure, torn between joy and sorrow,it may be assumed that in him Passion is predominant. ",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

" That intellect which understands the creation and dissolution of life, what actions should be done and what not, which discriminates between fear and fearlessness, bondage and deliverance, that is Pure. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" The intellect which does not understand what is right and what is wrong, and what should be done and what not, is under the sway of Passion. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
" And that which, shrouded in Ignorance, thinks wrong right, and sees everything perversely, O Arjuna, that intellect is ruled by Darkness. ",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
" The conviction and steady concentration by which the mind, the vitality and the senses are controlled – O Arjuna! They are the product of Purity. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
" The conviction which always holds fast to rituals, to self-interest and wealth, for the sake of what they may bring forth – that comes from Passion. ",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

" That which as first is like nectar, because the senses revel in their objects, but in the end acts like poison – that pleasure arises from Passion. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
