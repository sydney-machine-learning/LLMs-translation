The scriptures are its leaves, and he who understands this, knows. "
2,अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृतास्तस्य शाखागुणप्रवृद्धा विषयप्रवाला: ।अधश्च मूलान्यनुसन्ततानिकर्मानुबन्धीनि मनुष्यलोके ॥ २ ॥," Its branches shoot upwards and downwards, deriving their nourishment from the Qualities; its buds are the objects of sense; and its roots, which follow the Law causing man’s regeneration and degeneration, pierce downwards into the soil.

"
6,न तद्भ‍ासयते सूर्यो न शशाङ्को न पावक: ।यद्ग‍त्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम ॥ ६ ॥," Neither sun, moon, nor fire shines there. Those who go towards that place never come back. For, O Arjuna, that is my Celestial Home! "
