2,काम्यानां कर्मणां न्यासं सन्न्यासं कवयो विदु: ।सर्वकर्मफलत्यागं प्राहुस्त्यागं विचक्षणा: ॥ २ ॥, Lord Shri Krishna replied: The sages say that renunciation means forgoing an action which springs from desire; and relinquishing means the surrender of its fruit. 
3,त्याज्यं दोषवदित्येके कर्म प्राहुर्मनीषिण: ।यज्ञदानतप:कर्म न त्याज्यमिति चापरे ॥ ३ ॥," Some philosophers say that all action is evil and should be abandoned. Others that acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up. "
4,निश्चयं श‍ृणु मे तत्र त्यागे भरतसत्तम ।त्यागो हि पुरुषव्याघ्र त्रिविध: सम्प्रकीर्तित: ॥ ४ ॥,O best of Indians! Listen to my judgment as regards this problem. It has a threefold aspect.
5,यज्ञदानतप:कर्म न त्याज्यं कार्यमेव तत् ।यज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् ॥ ५ ॥,"Acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up but should be performed, for they purify the aspiring soul."
6,एतान्यपि तु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलानि च ।कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितं मतमुत्तमम् ॥ ६ ॥, But they should be done with detachment and without thought of recompense. This is my final judgment.

"
11,न हि देहभृता शक्यं त्यक्तुं कर्माण्यशेषत: ।यस्तु कर्मफलत्यागी स त्यागीत्यभिधीयते ॥ ११ ॥," But since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action, in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation. "

"
26,मुक्तसङ्गोऽनहंवादी धृत्युत्साहसमन्वित: ।सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योर्निर्विकार: कर्ता सात्त्विक उच्यते ॥ २६ ॥," But when a man has no sentiment and no personal vanity, when he possesses courage and confidence, cares not whether he succeeds or fails, then his action arises from Purity. "
